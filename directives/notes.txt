 @apply Directive:
The @apply directive allows you to use Tailwind's utility classes inside a CSS rule.
It helps keep styles organized and reusable, similar to writing traditional CSS but using Tailwind classes.
@layer Directive:
The @layer directive defines styles within specific layers (base, components, utilities).
It ensures that styles are correctly applied in Tailwind’s processing order. 


When to Use @layer and @apply in Tailwind CSS?
Use @layer When:
You want to define styles within Tailwind’s processing order (base, components, utilities).
You need to ensure styles are preserved after Tailwind generates utility classes.
Example:

@layer components {
    .btn {
        @apply bg-blue-500 text-white px-4 py-2 rounded;
    }
}
✅ Ensures .btn is part of the components layer.
Use @apply When:
You want to reuse Tailwind utility classes inside a CSS rule.
You need to keep styles consistent while avoiding inline utility classes.
Example:

.btn {
    @apply bg-blue-500 text-white px-4 py-2 rounded;
}
✅ Applies Tailwind utilities directly without needing @layer.
Key Rule:
Use @apply for individual class styling.
Use @layer when organizing styles inside Tailwind’s layers (base, components, utilities).
